        width: calc(6/12 *100%);
    }
}

@media (min-width:576px) and (max-width: 768){
    .col-sm-4{
        width: calc(4/12 * 100%);
    }
    .col-sm-5{
        width: calc(5/12 * 100%);
    }
    .col-sm-7{

Responsive Design

*Units

Pecentages - a unit relative to the enclosing parent

em - unit relative to the parent but is usually relative to its font-size. If we use em to display takes the relative unit of itself

rem - unit relative to the parent but is usually relative to the root element's font-size which is HTML

Mobile vs. Desktop

Mobile First - You're expected to develop a software/webpage that will comply to mobile screens. It's a more functional approach which caters to mobile audience. This focuses in content-first.

Desktop First - Traditional, office audience. We can more features in a desktop application compared to mobile, feature-rich.

BEM Naming Methodology or Model

Block__Element--Modifier - a naming convention which adheres to proper namin and concise relation of elements and its classes or IDs.

Javascript

Primitive Data Types
- number
- undefined - it is undefined
- string
- boolean
- null (it is the base of all object. it is a type of object)
- symbol
- bigint

primitive data types cannot contain method and functions

Basic Data Types
let
const 
var

Passing by value - we are making a copy memory of the actual parameters value. This is relative to primitive data type.

Javascript Equality

'=='
Coercion - converts the value of a string to a number data type or the like

'==='
strict equality compares the two values based on data types

Truthy and Falsy

Falsy is a value considrered false to be a put in a boolean
-falsy:0, -0, 0n, empty strings('', "", ``), null, undefined, Not a Number (NaN), document.all (this is an object while objects usually are not a falsy)
