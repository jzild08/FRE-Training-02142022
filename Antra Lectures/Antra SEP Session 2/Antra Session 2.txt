External CSS - using link tag inside the head tag (lowest priority) - based on priority in the header
Style Tag - using <style> tag inside the head tag (mid priority) - based on priority in the header
Inline Attribute - Using inline attribute such as <div style="color:red"> (highest Priority)

but the sequence of the styles that are rendered matter. This is based on Priority and Specificity

Pseudo Elements and Classes

pseudo classes starts with a single colon while elements starts with a double colon

ex. div:hover - pseudo class
    div::before - pseudo element
    
CSS Reset

ex. 
*, *::before, *::after{
    padding: 0;
    margin:0;
    box-sizing:border-box;
}

* - the asterisk is a selector which selects all (elements). It is also called Universal Selector

box-sizing sets how the total width and height of an element is calculated.

id - has the highest priority in an external css file

class - is the second priotity in an external css file

element - is the leat priority in an external css file

attribute selector such as this example:

div[class^='con']{
    background-color:green
}
